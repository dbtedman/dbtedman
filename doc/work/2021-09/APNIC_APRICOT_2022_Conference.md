## Business Need

APNIC hosts two conferences a year, and to support these conferences, the Web Team is responsible for maintaining a website for each conference along with the platform needed to support these websites.

## Our Solution

A statically generated website that accesses data provided by an administration system used to manage the conference schedule. An API was built to support integrations with Salesforce, Zoom, and Cometchat.

## My Contribution

As the Delivery Manager for the Web Team, my role is to support my team in delivering a successful conference.
