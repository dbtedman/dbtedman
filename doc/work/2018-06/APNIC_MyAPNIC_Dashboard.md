## Business Need

APNIC did not have a good “homepage” for logged in users where contextually relevant resources developed by APNIC could be presented in a single interface.

## Our Solution

Leveraging the extensibility of the WordPress platform, a dashboard was developed to present widgets displaying data from each of several APNIC developed systems.

## My Contribution

As the primary developer of this product, I contributed to all aspects of development.
