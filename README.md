## Day Job

I currently work as a Lead Full Stack Web Developer at [APNIC](https://www.apnic.net), where I have the privilege of contributing to the organisations vision
for ["A global, open, stable, and secure Internet"](https://www.apnic.net/about-apnic/organization/vision-mission-objectives/).

## Open Source

I believe in sharing my knowledge and expertise with the wider development community, and that open source software is a
key method to achieve this goal.
